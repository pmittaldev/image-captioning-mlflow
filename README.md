# Image captioning with ResNet and LSTM

This project is an implementation of a deep learning model that generates captions for images. The model is based on a convolutional neural network (ResNet) and a recurrent neural network (LSTM). The ResNet is used to extract features from the images, and the LSTM generates captions based on these features.

Also integrated with MLflow for tracking the model's performance and hyperparameters. 

Deployment is done using MLflow server.
